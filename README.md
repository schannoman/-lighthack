<h1>#Lighthack</h1>

These are projects based original on the #lighthack project from ETC https://github.com/ETCLabs/lighthack
You find further informations also in the ETC forum https://community.etcconnect.com/etclabs/f/lighthack
All projects uses an Arduino Arduino UNO, but also an Arduino MEGA gives you connection to your console. On nomad you can use other boards, but you have to figure out which works.

<h1>Important Notes</h1>
Pinout for the Encoder wheels is slightly different from the EOS box1 code. 
This code uses <b>A0, A1, A2, A3</b> respectively for encoder wheels and I am unable to find where to change this in the code.
<br><br>
This also requires the encoder button connections to be soldered in and connected to function. Box1 instructions do not include this, and your encoders may vary.
<br><br>
You can select encoder groups in twos from the list provided, Arduino Uno can handle a maximum of 14 parameters (7 pairs). 
I leave some blank using none for better grouping. This is entirely flexible. 

<h1>Dependencies</h1>
Requires the Arduino OSC parsing library maintained by the great folks over at CNMAT. https://github.com/CNMAT/OSC
The assembly instructions documents contain details on how to add this to your Arduino project.
